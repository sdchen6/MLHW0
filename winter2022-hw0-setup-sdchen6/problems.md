## Problems

### Environment Setup and Code Implementation (4 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. You will need to use NumPy, which is a Python library for scientific computing. You will use NumPy for all the homeworks throughout this course. Read this tutorial first to learn about NumPy: https://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy. Each test case in this homework is weighted equally to make the overall score (e.g. if you pass half the test cases, you get half the points).

### Free-response Questions (6 points) 
Answer the following free-response questions to this (and every subsequent) homework in a separate document, saved as a **.pdf** and **uploaded to Canvas**. You can find some of these answers in the course Syllabus on Canvas.

1. Submitting Homeworks:
    * How, where, and in what file format do you submit free-response answers to each homework? (0.5 points)

        There is a Canvas assignment, where we will submit free response answers as a PDF file.

    * How and where is your code to be submitted? (0.5 points)

       Code is submitted by pushing to the repository on GitHub.
    
 1. Late Policy:
    * What time is the deadline for submitting homework on the due date? (1 point)
        11 PM
    * Say the homework is due at 11 PM on Jan 26. You end up submitting your homework at 12:01 AM on Jan 27. What is the penalty percentage? (0.5 points)
        10% penalty
    * Say the homework is due at 11 PM on Jan 26. You end up submitting your homework at 12:00 AM on Jan 28. What is the penalty percentage? (0.5 points)
        25% penalty
    * Say the homework is due at 11 PM on Jan 26. You end up submitting your homework at 3:00 PM on Jan 29. What is the penalty percentage? (0.5 points)
        50% penalty
    * Say the homework is due at 11 PM on Jan 26. You end up submitting your homework at 3:00 PM on Jan 30. What is the penalty percentage? (0.5 points)
        100% penalty

1. COVID-19 and Health:
    * If you're feeling ill, should you come to class in person? (0.5 points)
        No, definetly not.
    * What will happen during in-person lecture in the classroom if even one student refuses to wear a mask covering their mouth and nose? (0.5 points)
        Class will be halted until that person either leaves or puts on a mask.

1. Academic Integrity:
    * Are you required to do your own coding and to answer your own questions individually on the homework? (0.5 points)
        Yes
    * What is allowed in terms of collaboration on homeworks in this class? (0.5 points)
        CANNOT copy code. However, we can talk to help each other understand concepts. We need to stay away from pair programming, however.
